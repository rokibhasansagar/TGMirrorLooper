### What This Is, Really

This repository is used for occasional download/upload from internet to google drive.

I do not recommend you to snoop around with it, as it is strictly for personal use.

Please, go away!

### _Disclaimer_

It is not your playground for harmful experimenting for nuclear power generation.

If I find anyone abusing this repo with any fork, I'll not be responsible for any damage that might happen (and certainly will happen, I assure you) to your abused repo as-well-as account.

I do not support abusing Github's resources for personal illegal gain.

So, I'd never do that if I were you. You've been warned.
